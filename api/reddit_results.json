        "question_text": "[Post RD Purge] Ultimate Stremio Setup | Stremio + Torrentio/Comet + RD/AD\n\n# Opening Notes (Read Before Continuing)\n\n* So as we know, RD basically got purged and everyone had to basically migrated to other services like Premiumize, AllDebrid, Torbox etc. In this guide though, I'll only be talking about **Real Debrid & AllDebrid**, Mainly because their both the cheapest to entry in Stremio. Not requiring too much to get started nor set up. **This is a beginner friendly guide, this will be a extremely long and detailed post but will help everyone get started and setup to perfection!**\n* For anyone new, you will need [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) **&** [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/) to follow this guide fully. Just sign up and create accounts on both. **Of course this choice is always optional, you can only get one.** But if RD goes down, I would like to have a backup like AD. Besides both aren't that expensive, I recommend the 90 days but it's ultimately up to you!\n* **Real Debrid** does work after the Purge, but it got stripped of many things. **So it won't be the same.** Meaning that, stuff on there before isn't going to be on there now. This Purge is so new that we don't know the extent of the damage or if content will be added to Real Debrid after this. RD works now thanks to a [Workaround by BeastLT and his team.](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper/issues/305) All thanks go to them and the countless threads I saw after the RD Purge.\n\n# Onto the actual guide | Pre-Setup\n\n**I'm assuming you have a Stremio/RD/AD Account!**\n\n**-**\n\n1. After having all the necessary things. Make sure to login into your Stremio and **delete any non-official plugin (Click the Puzzle Piece Addons tab and make sure the Official Tab matches the My Addons Tab).** We do this because we want a fresh install of Stremio so we can all start on the same base.\n2. Make sure to have : Cinemeta | OpenSubtitlesV3 | Local Files installed! That's all for Pre-setup!\n\n# Bootstrap | What to Keep/Not Keep & Install\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1anozbpq2l2e1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b7ad47061449fd38f7bd2c3d86c51c9a5e4a58a\n\n**All credits for Bootstrap go to** [DryK1llLogic](https://www.reddit.com/user/DryK1llLogic/)  **for his incredible work on streamlining the Setup process! Couldn't be thankful enough for his contributions to this community and the Moderation team in general for their awesome Guides!**\n\n**-**\n\n1. Click on this [Bootstrap Setup](https://stremio-account-bootstrapper.vercel.app/) link to get started! Follow the instructions provided. As it warns, **it will wipe your existing Stremio Setup.** But we should be good since you wiped your stuff. When it asks for a **Debrid API Key,** just use either your RD API or AD API. I personally used my **AllDebrid API Key.** For Real Debrid, copy & paste the API Key. For AllDebrid make sure to copy the single API Key under \"alldebridkeys\"\n2. After you load the **Addon Preset**, decide which addons to keep! After you have click Stremio Sync.\n3. You can always add your [RPDB Key](https://ratingposterdb.com/) if you purchase one of course. **(This adds highly optional ratings to Stremio, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes etc.)**\n\n* **Personally I keep the following!**\n\n1. **Torrentio** : A must have, allows unlocking of *content* for all your streaming needs. **(IMPORTANT : For Debrid Options select only the 2ND OPTION)**\n2. **The Movie Database** : Basically an alternative to Cinemeta. Allows you to actually see the movies/series in Stremio\n3. **Comet** : The 2nd best provider of *content* personally for me! If Torrentio is down, Comet is always my second option!\n4. **Cinemeta** : Even though TMDB essentially replaces Cinemeta in seeing movies/series in Stremio. I still keep Cinemeta. More things to view even if they are the same, having options is always welcomed.\n5. **Anime Kitsu** : I'm an anime fan, more options for anime I like. Torrentio provides the *anime content* already but having Kitsu as an alternative provides even more options. Options are always good.\n6. **OpenSubtitles/Pro** \\- Both of these are subtitle addons\\*\\*.\\*\\* Just install em, free subtitles.\n7. **Local Files** : Just keep this one installed.\n\n* **Personally I delete the following!**\n\n1. **Trakt** : Trakt for me is simply too complicated. Requiring another sign up to something sucks. So I simply don't use it. Controversial take but it's what I think. If my small noodle can't comprehend, then it's a no. **Feel free to experiment with it though!**\n2. **Streamify** : There are simply better options than this *content.* No Real Debrid or AllDebrid support kills this for me!\n3. **KnightCrawler** : Same as Streamify, it was once good but now it's not that great and highly unreliable!\n\n* **Personally I install the following add-ons!**\n* **Search the name of this Subreddit and you'll find what your looking for!**\n\n1. **Cyberflix Catalog** : A must have to sort all your *content and the providers* to your liking. Just install it by clicking the green install button. Thank me later.\n2. **USA TV** : Another add-on from [DryK1llLogic](https://www.reddit.com/user/DryK1llLogic/) this one allows the viewing of Live TV. Meaning cable woohoo! Thank the gods that my mom can watch Univision on a modern TV haha! Definitely install this for some nostalgia, a must!\n\n* **With all of those deleted or installed and configured to your liking, it's time to get both RD/AD working with both Torrentio/Comet! Or of course you could stop here!**\n\n# Torrentio/Comet RD+AD & Addon Manager\n\n* If you did the setup with **AllDebrid API** then switch to your **Real Debrid API** & Vice Versa for starting with Real Debrid.\n* **Torrentio**\n* Open your Torrentio Config in Stremio and choose the **following optional recommended settings.**\n\n1. **Providers : 12**\n2. **Quality & Seeders**\n3. **No Priority Foreign Language**\n4. **Exclude Qualities : Dolby V | Dolby V + HDR | 720p | 480p | Screener | Unknown (Edit : If your TV supports Dolby + HDR, you can enable them, just cause I don't use it doesn't mean you don't have too)**\n5. **Max Results : 5 or 10**\n6. **No Change for Video Limit**\n7. **If you did initial setup with AD, put your Debrid Provider as Real Debrid. If done with RD put it as AllDebrid & copy and paste the necessary API Key as before.**\n8. **In Debrid Options choose the 2nd option only!**\n\n* **If you did it right, your Torrentio should now say Torrentio RD/AD. If it does then your all set for Torrentio!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2e54120opl2e1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e571ef1b6f8cad091eb7b4243e868750bd85a5\n\n* **Comet**\n* As with Torrentio, open the Comet Config & **follow the recommended optional settings.**\n\n1. **Don't change Indexers & Languages**\n2. **Resolutions I have are 1080p | Unknown (though unknown can be deselected if you wish and also enable any other resolutions you wish like 567p, 720p or 360p etc. My guide isn't law it's just purely recommendations.)**\n3. **Max Results : 10 | Results Per Resolution : 5**\n4. **Don't mess with Max Size or Proxy Password**\n5. **If you used AD during setup then switch to RD with the RD API Key. You do the opposite if you started with Real Debrid. Comet doesn't merge together, rather you get a RD Version and AD Version. Thus having the best of both worlds!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0nxyguhql2e1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6a32c9eb91b6f91b4d27129ffa260e2063114a2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vuh3a0jql2e1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca3ccd8aef2a1db030812e5b9d4b85155f2d876e\n\n* **At this point, if you followed everything right you should have Comet AD and Comet RD! Now your all set!**\n\n# Errors & Stremio Addon Manager (Optional)\n\n* **Errors**\n\n1. I have encountered an annoying error regarding **Comet.** Where it sometimes says **Login Invalid : Please Check Your Email when accessing a show.** This mainly comes from **AllDebrid** and it conflicting with Stremio for some reason lol. **AllDebrid sends you an email warning that \"someone's accessing your account\".** I recommend muting the automatic sender because clearly that someone is you and it gets annoying having to check your email. **For a fix I found simply backing out of the show/movie and going back in actually loads Comet correctly though it does take a little, if not. Then check your email and check the sign in. Do this only once, then just either mute the emails or block the AllDebrid sender. This is the only error I have gotten.**\n\n**Stremio Addon Manager**\n\n1. Stremio Addon Manager is basically a **re organizer** for your Addons! Go to the [Stremio Addon Manager](https://stremio-addon-manager.vercel.app/) and add your Stremio credentials.\n2. It'll then give you a list of your addons and you can drag your addons in any order you wish!\n3. **A recommended Setup is the following**\n\n* **The Movie Database**\n* **Cinemeta**\n* **Cyberflix Catalog**\n* **Local Files**\n* **Opensubtitles**\n* **Opensubtitles Pro**\n* **Comet AD**\n* **Comet RD**\n* **Torrentio AD/RD**\n* **Anime Kitsu**\n* **USA TV**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith this last optional setup you're officially done! This took me a whole evening to type up! I wanted to create this to provide those new and old to Stremio an answer to the recent RD Purge. It was written by me, with heavy research and testing on my end! If you have any questions DM me and I promise i'll get back to you regarding this. But everything should work great! Of course I'm just one random on the internet, I don't know if this set up will last but it works for me. So why couldn't it work for others?

You do the opposite if you started with Real Debrid. Comet doesn't merge together, rather you get a RD Version and AD Version.

Now your all set!**\n\n# Errors & Stremio Addon Manager (Optional)\n\n* **Errors**\n\n1. I have encountered an annoying error regarding **Comet.** Where it sometimes says **Login Invalid : Please Check Your Email when accessing a show.** This mainly comes from **AllDebrid** and it conflicting with Stremio for some reason lol. **AllDebrid sends you an email warning that \"someone's accessing your account\".** I recommend muting the automatic sender because clearly that someone is you and it gets annoying having to check your email. **For a fix I found simply backing out of the show/movie and going back in actually loads Comet correctly though it does take a little, if not. Then check your email and check the sign in. Do this only once, then just either mute the emails or block the AllDebrid sender. This is the only error I have gotten.**\n\n**Stremio Addon Manager**\n\n1. Stremio Addon Manager is basically a **re organizer** for your Addons! Go to the [Stremio Addon Manager](https://stremio-addon-manager.vercel.app/) and add your Stremio credentials.\n2. It'll then give you a list of your addons and you can drag your addons in any order you wish!\n3. **A recommended Setup is the following**\n\n* **The Movie Database**\n* **Cinemeta**\n* **Cyberflix Catalog**\n* **Local Files**\n* **Opensubtitles**\n* **Opensubtitles Pro**\n* **Comet AD**\n* **Comet RD**\n* **Torrentio AD/RD**\n* **Anime Kitsu**\n* **USA TV**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith this last optional setup you're officially done! This took me a whole evening to type up! I wanted to create this to provide those new and old to Stremio an answer to the recent RD Purge. It was written by me, with heavy research and testing on my end! If you have any questions DM me and I promise i'll get back to you regarding this. But everything should work great! Of course I'm just one random on the internet, I don't know if this set up will last but it works for me. So why couldn't it work for others? I spent a lot of trial and error trying to figure this out, looking at Reddit threads and such. Seeing people struggle after the RD Purge made me motivated to create my own solution. This is what I came up with.\n\n**Hope you enjoyed the read or scroll down! Worked hard on this to make it as detailed as possible.

        "question_text": "[Post RD Purge] Ultimate Stremio Setup | Stremio + Torrentio/Comet + RD/AD\n\n# Opening Notes (Read Before Continuing)\n\n* So as we know, RD basically got purged and everyone had to basically migrated to other services like Premiumize, AllDebrid, Torbox etc. In this guide though, I'll only be talking about **Real Debrid & AllDebrid**, Mainly because their both the cheapest to entry in Stremio. Not requiring too much to get started nor set up. **This is a beginner friendly guide, this will be a extremely long and detailed post but will help everyone get started and setup to perfection!**\n* For anyone new, you will need [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) **&** [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/) to follow this guide fully. Just sign up and create accounts on both. **Of course this choice is always optional, you can only get one.** But if RD goes down, I would like to have a backup like AD. Besides both aren't that expensive, I recommend the 90 days but it's ultimately up to you!\n* **Real Debrid** does work after the Purge, but it got stripped of many things. **So it won't be the same.** Meaning that, stuff on there before isn't going to be on there now. This Purge is so new that we don't know the extent of the damage or if content will be added to Real Debrid after this. RD works now thanks to a [Workaround by BeastLT and his team.](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper/issues/305) All thanks go to them and the countless threads I saw after the RD Purge.\n\n# Onto the actual guide | Pre-Setup\n\n**I'm assuming you have a Stremio/RD/AD Account!**\n\n**-**\n\n1. After having all the necessary things. Make sure to login into your Stremio and **delete any non-official plugin (Click the Puzzle Piece Addons tab and make sure the Official Tab matches the My Addons Tab).** We do this because we want a fresh install of Stremio so we can all start on the same base.\n2. Make sure to have : Cinemeta | OpenSubtitlesV3 | Local Files installed! That's all for Pre-setup!\n\n# Bootstrap | What to Keep/Not Keep & Install\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1anozbpq2l2e1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b7ad47061449fd38f7bd2c3d86c51c9a5e4a58a\n\n**All credits for Bootstrap go to** [DryK1llLogic](https://www.reddit.com/user/DryK1llLogic/)  **for his incredible work on streamlining the Setup process! Couldn't be thankful enough for his contributions to this community and the Moderation team in general for their awesome Guides!**\n\n**-**\n\n1. Click on this [Bootstrap Setup](https://stremio-account-bootstrapper.vercel.app/) link to get started! Follow the instructions provided. As it warns, **it will wipe your existing Stremio Setup.** But we should be good since you wiped your stuff. When it asks for a **Debrid API Key,** just use either your RD API or AD API. I personally used my **AllDebrid API Key.** For Real Debrid, copy & paste the API Key. For AllDebrid make sure to copy the single API Key under \"alldebridkeys\"\n2. After you load the **Addon Preset**, decide which addons to keep! After you have click Stremio Sync.\n3. You can always add your [RPDB Key](https://ratingposterdb.com/) if you purchase one of course. **(This adds highly optional ratings to Stremio, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes etc.)**\n\n* **Personally I keep the following!**\n\n1. **Torrentio** : A must have, allows unlocking of *content* for all your streaming needs. **(IMPORTANT : For Debrid Options select only the 2ND OPTION)**\n2. **The Movie Database** : Basically an alternative to Cinemeta. Allows you to actually see the movies/series in Stremio\n3. **Comet** : The 2nd best provider of *content* personally for me! If Torrentio is down, Comet is always my second option!\n4. **Cinemeta** : Even though TMDB essentially replaces Cinemeta in seeing movies/series in Stremio. I still keep Cinemeta. More things to view even if they are the same, having options is always welcomed.\n5. **Anime Kitsu** : I'm an anime fan, more options for anime I like. Torrentio provides the *anime content* already but having Kitsu as an alternative provides even more options. Options are always good.\n6. **OpenSubtitles/Pro** \\- Both of these are subtitle addons\\*\\*.\\*\\* Just install em, free subtitles.\n7. **Local Files** : Just keep this one installed.\n\n* **Personally I delete the following!**\n\n1. **Trakt** : Trakt for me is simply too complicated. Requiring another sign up to something sucks. So I simply don't use it. Controversial take but it's what I think. If my small noodle can't comprehend, then it's a no. **Feel free to experiment with it though!**\n2. **Streamify** : There are simply better options than this *content.* No Real Debrid or AllDebrid support kills this for me!\n3. **KnightCrawler** : Same as Streamify, it was once good but now it's not that great and highly unreliable!\n\n* **Personally I install the following add-ons!**\n* **Search the name of this Subreddit and you'll find what your looking for!**\n\n1. **Cyberflix Catalog** : A must have to sort all your *content and the providers* to your liking. Just install it by clicking the green install button. Thank me later.\n2. **USA TV** : Another add-on from [DryK1llLogic](https://www.reddit.com/user/DryK1llLogic/) this one allows the viewing of Live TV. Meaning cable woohoo! Thank the gods that my mom can watch Univision on a modern TV haha! Definitely install this for some nostalgia, a must!\n\n* **With all of those deleted or installed and configured to your liking, it's time to get both RD/AD working with both Torrentio/Comet! Or of course you could stop here!**\n\n# Torrentio/Comet RD+AD & Addon Manager\n\n* If you did the setup with **AllDebrid API** then switch to your **Real Debrid API** & Vice Versa for starting with Real Debrid.\n* **Torrentio**\n* Open your Torrentio Config in Stremio and choose the **following optional recommended settings.**\n\n1. **Providers : 12**\n2. **Quality & Seeders**\n3. **No Priority Foreign Language**\n4. **Exclude Qualities : Dolby V | Dolby V + HDR | 720p | 480p | Screener | Unknown (Edit : If your TV supports Dolby + HDR, you can enable them, just cause I don't use it doesn't mean you don't have too)**\n5. **Max Results : 5 or 10**\n6. **No Change for Video Limit**\n7. **If you did initial setup with AD, put your Debrid Provider as Real Debrid.

        "question_text": "Analysis: Assassin's Creed highlights a very concerning trend regarding how game audio is being poorly handled.\n\n**Updated @ 11:28 AM CST 2022/01/29:** Sadly Ubisoft have admitted that the low bitrate audio cannot be improved because [it is not feasible](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/689991). It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

[ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing.

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3.

[They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage. [Partly sourced from another post](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1021767). [ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc.

You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

[ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing.

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz.

The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T.

Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

        "answer_text": "I work as a sound designer in AAA games.  This audio compression setting is likely due to memory constraints with console memory, not due to wanting to keep disc size low.  We audio folk have to juggle memory allocation with art, code, animation, fx...etc...to fit into console memory, so we have to compress the audio to get it to playback readily in game.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed things like foley/footsteps/player abilities/animations all have to fit into memory.  We're actually not worried about overall file size of the executable at all, we're just struggling to get sounds to play back readily when you press the button to make something happen.\n\nAudio such as ambience and music don't have to playback via RAM because they don't have as much sensitivity when it comes to timing up with framerate dependent actions.  We usually stream that type of audio in through Wwise's streaming engine and typically those types of sounds can play back at much higher quality.\n\nWe're hoping as we learn to develop on PS5/Xbox One, that the the new SSD's will allow us to have fewer of these technical limitations as much because we'll have more memory between RAM/SSD's to ramp up compression on audio files and play them back at higher quality.\n\nI don't see the increasing trend of audio compression becoming more and more of a theme this next console cycle, I think it's more likely the Valhalla team just ran up to the edge of what this generation is capable of given the gigantic scope of their game and the limitations of the previous gen hardware.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

        "question_text": "Analysis: Assassin's Creed highlights a very concerning trend regarding how game audio is being poorly handled.\n\n**Updated @ 11:28 AM CST 2022/01/29:** Sadly Ubisoft have admitted that the low bitrate audio cannot be improved because [it is not feasible](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/689991). It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage. [Partly sourced from another post](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1021767). [ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin.

You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

[ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing.

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz.

[They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage. [Partly sourced from another post](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1021767). [ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria?

Surely this would just be a caveat in order for it to optimally work with the detected hardware, similarly to the VRAM warnings recent games often have whenever users accidentally select \"Ultra\" texture quality.\n\nI'm curious to know if Ubisoft will technically elaborate on the reasoning why, to end the speculation once and for all.",

You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

[ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

        "answer_text": "No problem!\n\nTechnically Wwise allows audio teams to set individual compression settings per SKU, but it can become quite a thing to micromanage when you're running up against deadlines, especially a deadline that involves shipping the game on 4 consoles during a new console year as well as PC.  In theory, Valhalla could get a patch on PC or next gen consoles to increase the compression, but it is bit of a tricky and time consuming process that would need to be carefully vetted so that it doesn't cause more audio bugs like...well...the worst audio bug of all: no audio playing.  Hahaha \\*begins weeping\\*\n\nI personally don't know about all of the tools and limitations the Valhalla team have.  My team uses Wwise and Unreal 4 currently.  Big open world games are highly demanding on memory and streaming allocation, so I'm sure the choices that their audio team had to make were tough.\n\nOverall they make great sounding audio assets and mix their games quite well and I'm sure we'll see better compression settings on future titles as the old consoles fade out.",

If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage.

I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing.

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB. At a minimum it would be 9 GB since we are doubling the sample rate. Still not very large, but it would be a light and day difference for sound quality.\n\nIf you're curious to experiment with file size estimations, here's a neat [audio filesize calculator](https://toolstud.io/video/audiosize.php).\n\n## Is there a solution?\n\nThe idealistic solution would be to re-export all sound effects and voice using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, with the OGG quality parameter set between -q 0.4 and -q 0.6. They could then deliver this as a compulsory patch or a free regional high quality sound pack DLC.\n\nPopular games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Monster Hunter: World and even Ubisoft's own [Watch Dogs 2](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025708/Ultra-Texture-Pack-Installation) have all received DLC addons that increase the quality of the game experience.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIs it acceptable to allow such a fundamental aspect of a game to suffer a significant loss of frequencies in order to meet that distribution criteria? Absolutely not. This sets a neglectful precedent and one that not only severely destroys immersion, but attempts to normalize poor quality sound to the masses. Here's another question for you. If you bought a Blu-ray box set of your favourite show or movie trilogy, would you be satisified knowing that they replaced the lossless DTS-HD 5.1 audio with muddy, tinny, anti-climatic explosions worthy of being peer-traded on KaZaA and Limewire? (I was born in the 80's so please excuse the reference).\n\nConsumer expectations within the film and gaming industry aren't that different, VR is evolving and the lines are blurring with every new AAA title. We are starting to expect the same kind of treatment: Detailed facial micro expressions, lip syncing, motion capture, in-game characters based on the likeness of real world actors and actresses, quality voice acting, and dare I say it, high quality sound effects, more commonly referred to as Foley within the film industry.\n\nI do not game in one room with a sub-par home media center, and watch films in another where my favourite monolith shaped speakers sit in each corner. If they were sentient and had a mouth and a stomach, I would expect vomit on the floor every time I embark on my journey with Odin. Instead, I have to deal with my audio producer brain punching my cochlea from the inside.\n\n## Final, final thoughts\n\nOddly many of the official reviews of AC:Valhalla I have read so far completely fail to mention the audio issues, and this is concerning. The issues are so obvious that they must have either purposefully omitted the critique, have sub-par sound systems, or couldn't care less. I remember back in the day when video games magazine reviewers took pride in providing a detailed opinion of sound effects and music. Fond memories of reading Zzap!64, Amiga Power and GamesMaster back in the day.\n\nHow do you guys feel about it? To me, the $60 price tag is a bit of a kick in the teeth, and I feel that Ubisoft should really have audio technicalities down to a T. Is this what we are meant to expect for a title with a AAA budget? Am I crazy for writing or caring this much?\n\nUbisoft could learn a thing or two from the guys and gals responsible for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They released 4K cinematics for free, along with higher quality in-game assets. We deserve to optionally download HD quality assets for Assassin's Creed, especially since there are many gamers among us that invest a great deal of time and money into our home cinema set-ups.\n\nHere is a current thread following this topic on the Ubisoft Player Support Forum:\n\n[Audio Issues: Bitrate / Dynamics & Balance / Muffled Sounds / Stuttering / Volume etc. | POST HERE](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/78569/pc-low-bitrate-audio-improperly-balanced-audio-dynamics-sounds-cutting-in-and-out/1)\n\nIf you read this all the way to the end, thank you. Let's hope that the trend of heavily compressed audio dies hard.\n\n*On a side note, since I've had a few people ask: I'm a music producer and songwriter on the side. Software dev by trade. Gaming, music and audio means everything to me.*\n\n## Recommended listening and current favourite soundtracks.

It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1.

It apparently requires an overhaul of their audio system from the ground up, likely induced by engine limitations. It also implies that any future AC game using the same engine will suffer the same consequences.\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2021/08/06:** The official thread has been split into multiple topics, for the benefit of isolating all the individual audio problems people are experiencing. Here is a link to the updated thread covering [low quality audio](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/99892/audio-sounds-compressed-of-a-low-bitrate-poor-quality-post-here/)\n\n**Updated @ 10:00 AM CST 2020/12/01:** Thanks to the attention of my support thread on the Ubisoft Forum, Ubisoft have finally acknowledged that there are audio problems. [They are urging users to reply with further information](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/post/477296)\n\n**Updated @ 11:55 AM CST 2020/11/20:** I had no idea this thread would resonate with so many of you, please excuse the pun. You have my sincere thanks for the reactions, comments, recommendations, corrections and affirmations.\n\n## TL;DR summary\n\nThe audio quality throughout the AC series has been progressively getting worse. This post analyses Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla, exposing the fact that heavily compressed low bitrate 24,000 Hz audio is utilized across all three titles. Origins and Odyssey was less noticeable because it mixed higher quality 44,100 Hz ambient environment sounds with low resolution 24,000 Hz combat, character and UI sounds. Valhalla was recently discovered to be the worst offender since it uses 24,000 Hz audio across the board.\n\nThe aim here is to provide a technical explanation, cross-comparison and to raise awareness of this bad trend. Audio is a fundamental immersive component of any AAA video game, and should be presented with the same level of quality that you would expect within the film and TV industry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis started out as a technical analysis of the in-game audio present in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it has since evolved into a topic of a wider scope; if you haven't played the past three AC games, Pandemic notwithstanding, let me be the first to tell you that we are in a predicament.\n\nThe idea of this thread is to not only educate, but try and prevent a problem before it becomes more of a problem. Since this is a technical subject, there will be references to sample rate, bit rate and codecs, but I feel like it is more common knowledge these days, especially due to the rise of content creators, or anyone who regularly deals with MP3 and video files.\n\nAdmittedly, there is much to talk about regarding Assassin's Creed, especially if you're of the opinion that the series died after the 2nd/Brotherhood or 3rd game. Set that conversation aside for a moment, grab a squeezy ball, punch a pillow, and let's talk about how Ubisoft are starting to set a horrible trend for in-game audio.\n\nSo I caved in like many others, gleeing at the prospect of virtually visiting my homeland as an axe-wielding maniac, and decided to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla after thoroughly enjoying my time eliminating the cultists from Odyssey. On launch day during my first playthrough I noticed something that sounded eerily familiar.\n\nI game using a pair of Mackie MR624 studio monitors, or if I feel like giving my neighbours a moment's rest, with my Beyerdynamic DT-770 PRO headphones. The audio I was hearing sounded muffled, or in layman's terms, a bit like listening through a pair of tin cans that were accidentally dropped into a cup of earl grey.\n\n## Analysis\n\nEnough was enough, I put my investigative cap on and started by first extracting the audio files using [Wwise-unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker), and proceeding to analyse the files using Adobe Audition. I discovered that the SFX are saved at a 24,000 Hz sample rate, with a variable bitrate that peaks at around 70 kbps. Yes, mystery unravelled, it really is that bad. Those of you who do not fully appreciate this technical blunder, might better appreciate it if I put it this way. Visually, it is the equivalent of removing 50% of the colours in a painting, and leaving smears where the details are.\n\nHere is a [screenshot of my analysis](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/ac-valhalla-audio-analysis.png).\n\nLooking at the Frequency Analysis tab, you can very clearly observe a frequency rolloff at around 11000 Hz. The low bitrate issue is also not just limited to the PC release. It is affecting all platforms.\n\nThis is an unusually strict choice of compression considering that the English audio and SFX only take up 4.5 GB of hard disk space. Standard CD audio is at 44,100 Hz (DVD standard is 48,000 Hz), and those are the two sample rates that nearly every streaming service, sound device and operating system are designed to work with.\n\nNow, you may have heard people say \"Oh, but your ears cannot hear above 20 kHz, so the missing detail is irrelevant\". Unfortunately, there is complexity surrounding this issue that the statement fails to address. Firstly, when you take a 24,000 Hz sound, the highest audible frequency will be 12,000 Hz. This is already 8000 Hz lower than what the human ear can detect. When frequencies are missing from the original sound, it also negatively impacts the entire representation of that sound. The more you remove, the more hollow and less defined it becomes.\n\nAre you curious to hear the difference?\n\n## Side by side audio comparison\n\nThis morning I recorded a YouTube video to highlight the differences between 24,000 Hz and 48,000 Hz.\n\n[Technical analysis of the poor quality audio used on Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)\n\nIf you'd rather hear a lossless version of the presentation, you can download the [audio file here](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_comparison.wav).\n\nAlternatively, you may also download the individual sound files used for the basis of this comparison:  ¬π[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_high\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_high_quality.ogg) &  ¬≤[sounds\\_sfx\\_3369\\_low\\_quality](https://www.filiposcar.com/private/valhalla/sounds_sfx_3369_low_quality.ogg)\n\nTo help provide an even more visual description of the issue at hand, [here's a comparitive study of sample rates performed by a reputable audio company](https://youtu.be/fZzMXdxbOes).\n\n## The Nyquist theorem\n\nIt has been over ten years since I last sat in an audio theory class, so I'm likely over-simplifying the technical details of this theorem. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and in addition, I would highly suggest reading an external official scientific resource.\n\nThe [Nyquist theorem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem) describes this better. Named after a Swedish-born American electronic engineer who worked on the speed of telegraphs in the 1920s, the Nyquist theorem states that a waveform must be sampled twice in order to get a true representation. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency recorded in order to be effective. Here is a table showing the Sample rate vs. Highest Frequency.\n\n|Sample rate|Highest Frequency|\n|:-|:-|\n|22,050 Hz|11,025 Hz|\n|24,000 Hz|12,000 Hz|\n|30,000 Hz|15,000 Hz|\n|44,100 Hz|22,050 Hz|\n|48,000 Hz|24,000 Hz|\n\nAs a result, if the highest frequency a human can hear is around 20,000 Hz, then 40,000 Hz is the lowest sampling rate you can use to accurately represent any sound that a human can hear. If you are listening to a recording of \"bad audio\", but to you it sounds acceptable, the issues are probably one of the following:\n\n1. Bad equipment: headphones, speakers or an improper sound configuration.\n2. The highest frequency of the sound in question was one half of the sample rate used.\n3. Your hearing is damaged or has deteriorated naturally with age. By the time we approach 40 years old, most of us will not able to discern individual tones above 15,000 Hz. If you would like to test your ears, try this [Human Hearing Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing). As a safety precaution, only perform this test at a medium or low volume.\n\nEven though the highest frequency our ears can detect is around 20,000 Hz, the sound frequencies that exists beyond our hearing range (overtones) greatly colour and impact the sound we hear. Therefore when we record digital audio and cut out those frequencies above 22,050 Hz with a high pass filter (we have to use a filter or else they would cause aliasing or noise in the sample), we are actually changing the original sound that we were trying to record. If you raise the sample rate, the recording will be more accurate. The trade-off is that it takes up more storage. [Partly sourced from another post](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1021767). [ScienceDirect overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem).\n\nThis theorem is still used today to digitize analog signals, nearly 100 years after Nyquist was an engineer at Bell Laboratories.\n\n## Oi mate! Don't take me for a mug.\n\nThis is when I had a revelation, realising that this issue has been slowly getting worse and worse with every new Assassin's Creed title released. The games are getting bigger, and sacrifices are being made as a result. I first noticed it with AC:Origins, but because some sounds are higher quality than others, it masks the issue to an extent.\n\nLet me clarify further. Both Origins and Odyssey have high quality stereo ambient background sounds that are bounced to 44,100 Hz with an average variable bitrate of 241 kbps, but then you have all of the mono UI, voice, interaction, footstep and fighting sounds that are bounced to 24,000 Hz, all lacking any convincing spatialization, unceremoniously resulting in a bubbling cauldron that is extremely disconcerting to the trained ear. I say trained, but if you take a minute to search online you will discover that gamers, including some gamers with hearing impairments, picked up on this very quickly and early on. Why? We care about sound.\n\nTo summarise how Origins and Odyssey attempts to mask the issue: Even though certain frequencies are missing from non-ambient sounds, the detailed ambience and music in the background compensates psychoacoustically for what is missing. Valhalla sounds worse because it sacrificed more, and it does not have any high quality ambient sounds.\n\nThere are far too many links to post, so here's only a small subset of threads that I hand picked, all complaining about the same thing. First up, Origins. ¬π[Really poor audio quality for voices](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/1780608-Really-poor-audio-quality-for-voices) ¬≤[I can't get into origins because of the bad audio quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8ugbml/i_cant_get_into_origins_because_of_the_game_bad/) ¬≥[What's up with Assassins Creed Origins audio?](https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-up-with-assassins-creed-origins-audio.206028/) ‚Å¥[Audio quality is so bad for AC Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7o7dvt/audio_quality_is_so_bad_for_ac_origins/) ‚Åµ[Terrible Audio Quality Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8tubyg/terrible_audio_quality_origins/)\n\nDoes it get better with Odyssey?

This can be confirmed by observing the [DTS logo printed on the disc itself](https://youtu.be/wYYs0m2ZucY?t=80).\n\nDTS audio bit rate values can be 1.5 Mbps 48/96 kHz, 16/24 bits (or with DTS-HD the bit rate can be 4.5 or 6.144 Mbps for encoded data), but due to the heavily compressed nature of the audio files in-game, it is not fully taking advantage of what this technology has to offer.\n\n## The Why?\n\nMy first question was: is the sacrifice of quality an attempt to try and cram as much in to meet a specific distribution criteria? I've spoken to a few people within the gaming industry personally about this, and the general consensus seems to be: Yes. Please pitch in here if you've had any first hand experience dealing with this. Realistically, it should only affect products within the physical realm, such as trying to compress the game in order to fit it onto a 50 GB (dual-layer) Blu-ray disc. Digital media does not suffer from this limitation, can be downloaded at our convenience and is much cheaper to distribute.\n\nIf they provided the sound at 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) with an average variable bitrate of 128-192 kbps, as an example, similar to the quality you would expect from streaming a song on Spotify, you would see the total size of the in-game audio increase from its heavily compressed 4.5 GB to approximately 9-12 GB.

        "answer_text": "This is a damn good question!  I love it.\n\nYou actually got it right...the word we use IS spacialization (or 3D audio/positioning) and it is 100% handled by the audio engine and in most games it's handled in real time or with some sort of hybrid setup.  \n\nOn the engine side, we set how far away it is you can hear that campfire from.  Let's say it's 3000 meters.  We can set the attenuation of that sound to 3000 in game meters and select the type of fade/roll-off we want for that sound.  So it can ramp down in volume pretty quickly the more you move away from it, or it can take a long time and then quickly ramp down once you get to 2500 meters.  It's all up to the designer!\n\nFor reverb/echo, that is a different trick.  For Borderlands 3 we used Microsoft's amazing Triton technology (they were super cool and let us borrow it, modify it, and then send our changes/improvements back to them) to help our engine understand indoor/outdoor spaces better to apply the right amount of convolution reverb to the setting.  We would have to bake in our convolution reverb settings using an intensive process that was similar to baking lighting for a level scene, but the result was something much more real world sounding that could make all of our sounds feel more lifelike whether you were outdoor, indoor, or in something in between because we could model real world reflections a lot more accurately.",

I created a feature request though, to at least store the response status: https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/issues/169.   \n\\* AI generated tag list is super long: There are 2 improvement stories: 1 to reuse existing tags (issue #111), which would reduce the amount of tags already. And there is another that would just improve performance (issue #382)\n\nOverall one of our big goals is to make the search much more useful, by allowing to use some kind of query language, where you would then be able to search by all kinds of properties (e.g. the status of the bookmark), but this will take a bit more time\n\nRegarding your last point, i can't help unfortunately.",

I thought I'd share it with the community here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1bo9tdq/introducing_hoarder_an_open_source/)) in case someone else finds it useful. I had zero expectations. Maybe a couple of stars on the repo and that's it. And boy, I was so wrong!\n\nThe reddit post received more engagement than what I'd have ever imagined. Suddenly, there's a lot of people using Hoarder, requesting features, and reporting bugs. I was so excited the first time I got a pull request in the repo. It was the usual typo fixes in the documentation, etc but still, someone took the time to contribute to Hoarder which I appreciated. A couple of days layer, out of nowhere, someone managed to navigate my code and submitted [a pull request](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/pull/88) for a full fledged feature end to end without me even knowing it was happening. Suddenly, Hoarder got PDF support. The power of open source!\n\nYou can't imagine how happy I get every time I see someone recommending Hoarder in one of the comments in this sub. Every time someone posts a screenshot of their self hosted dashboards, I skim through their apps to see if Hoarder makes an appearance there. And today, I woke up on a video from u/davidnburgess34 showcasing Hoarder ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklvlJ4YDtM)) that has thousands of views. This all started from just one post here, and I'm so grateful to this community.\n\nI haven't made any posts since the initial announcement of Hoarder 6 months ago as I didn't want to spam the sub with updates. Also u/shol-ly's great newsletter of \"This week in self-hosted\" already covers every release of Hoarder. But given that we recently hit 3k stars on github, I thought I can give you a quick summary about what changed since the initial announcement!\n\n**So what is Hoarder?** Hoarder is an open-source self-hosted bookmark-everything app with a touch of AI. You throw in anything you want (links, text, images, pdfs) and Hoarder will use LLMs to understand this content and automatically generate a bunch of tags for this content. Hoarder will also index this content giving you a blazingly fast full text search experience for faster retrieval!

The docker compose file itself is simpler by dropping the redis dependency and merging the web and workers containers (3 containers down from 5).\n* OpenAI integration is cheaper than ever: With the release of `gpt-4o-mini` you can generate tags literally for thousands of bookmarks and images for less than a $1.\n* To protect against link rot, Hoarder now can be configured to take full page offline archives (and screenshots) for the links you hoard.\n* Bulk actions to mass edit your bookmarks!\n* SSO support to login with authentik, authelia, etc.\n* Nested lists are now a thing.\n* Proper importing mechanisms from chrome, pocket and other netscape HTML formats preserving the tags and the titles of those imported bookmarks.\n* Attach notes to your bookmarks and customize the image banners.\n* Different layouts for your bookmark list (Masonry, Grid, List & Compact).\n* A tags cleanup feature that detects duplicates in your tags and suggests merging suggestions.\n* A [CLI](https://docs.hoarder.app/command-line) for those who want extra powers when manipulating their bookmarks.\n* And a lot more that you can find by browsing through the [release notes](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/releases).\n* In the next release, we'll also give you the ability to specify tagging rules in natural language (aka customizing the prompt!).\n\nAs you can tell, a lot has changed in 6 months.

        "question_text": "Hoarder üì¶ - The Bookmark Everything App - 3.5k Stars later!\n\nEarly this year, I built Hoarder as a side project of mine that addresses a need that I had. I thought I'd share it with the community here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1bo9tdq/introducing_hoarder_an_open_source/)) in case someone else finds it useful. I had zero expectations. Maybe a couple of stars on the repo and that's it. And boy, I was so wrong!\n\nThe reddit post received more engagement than what I'd have ever imagined. Suddenly, there's a lot of people using Hoarder, requesting features, and reporting bugs. I was so excited the first time I got a pull request in the repo. It was the usual typo fixes in the documentation, etc but still, someone took the time to contribute to Hoarder which I appreciated. A couple of days layer, out of nowhere, someone managed to navigate my code and submitted [a pull request](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder/pull/88) for a full fledged feature end to end without me even knowing it was happening. Suddenly, Hoarder got PDF support. The power of open source!\n\nYou can't imagine how happy I get every time I see someone recommending Hoarder in one of the comments in this sub. Every time someone posts a screenshot of their self hosted dashboards, I skim through their apps to see if Hoarder makes an appearance there. And today, I woke up on a video from u/davidnburgess34 showcasing Hoarder ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklvlJ4YDtM)) that has thousands of views. This all started from just one post here, and I'm so grateful to this community.\n\nI haven't made any posts since the initial announcement of Hoarder 6 months ago as I didn't want to spam the sub with updates. Also u/shol-ly's great newsletter of \"This week in self-hosted\" already covers every release of Hoarder. But given that we recently hit 3k stars on github, I thought I can give you a quick summary about what changed since the initial announcement!\n\n**So what is Hoarder?** Hoarder is an open-source self-hosted bookmark-everything app with a touch of AI. You throw in anything you want (links, text, images, pdfs) and Hoarder will use LLMs to understand this content and automatically generate a bunch of tags for this content. Hoarder will also index this content giving you a blazingly fast full text search experience for faster retrieval!

        "answer_text": "I just partially agree. Until Sequoia macOS lacked basic window management (split left/right, ...). There are still a few shortcomings (window previews when hovering dock icons, for example).\n\nOverall, many tools like BetterTouchTool, Keyboard Maestro, Hazel, iStat Menus, Little Snitch are power user tools for people that like to automate or customize certain aspects of their operating system.\n\nFor example, on Windows you might have \"hwinfo\" to monitor system temperature, but getting it to display the temperature in an aesthetic way in the task area is not possible. Both are non-stock OS features that more advanced users might want. To me macOS handles this much better.",

This was achieved using a technique which helped us do some \"educated guesswork\" about the letters, that has been slowly confirmed.\n\n**HOWEVER,** This is still **NOT** solved. There are sequences in the text currently represented as \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" as well as other pieces that actually represent unknowns. Some of the sequences are likely handwritten text or images that cannot be deciphered without actually assembling the image.\n\nTo do that, we are literally assembling these pixel by pixel, using the overlaps of letters to slowly generate a map of where ever point goes.\n\nAt the end of this it will generate a 44x48 pixel animated gif that is about 5.5 hours long, which we can take frame data from to create the pages.\n\n[Writeup updated by community members in the Discord](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJluBfMwPUJJLBtEPRa-llTykD9qs8hZSorzQtQkE24/edit)\n\n# Hello Guardians!\n\nWe need your help!

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**.

My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye!

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower. I live in the Caribbean and it's a sauna.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖü¶Ñ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TO48Cnl66w) THANK YOU! SINCERELY.\n\n*No, not you, Reddit.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**. Don't !@#$ around, because you don't want to find out.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüß´ [‚ô™] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.\n\n**PLEASE, IN RESPECT OF THE TIME AND ENERGY I'VE PUT INTO MAINTAINING THIS POST AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS, DO NOT GO HARASSING MSQSIMS.** They, along with other TSR members were compromised during this incident but they have since been secured and the compromised mod I show below has been removed and (I assume by now, since they disallowed all TS4SCRIPT mods at the time) replaced with the safe, proper mod.\n\n>!What? My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye! ITSUMI MALWARE in disguise! üëπ](https://preview.redd.it/f9ld0qn8njgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7aade09fdcfe4d98120f240b6594210171edbdf)\n\n[7-Zip can extract TS4SCRIPT files, huzzah!

If you're low, just hold on! Cause I will be your safety!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpsDamWdIM)\n\nI have adored Dido since her mainstream breakout with Eminem in the song [Stan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY). She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower. I live in the Caribbean and it's a sauna.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖü¶Ñ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TO48Cnl66w) THANK YOU! SINCERELY.\n\n*No, not you, Reddit.

Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script.

Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity.

IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**. Don't !@#$ around, because you don't want to find out.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüß´ [‚ô™] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.\n\n**PLEASE, IN RESPECT OF THE TIME AND ENERGY I'VE PUT INTO MAINTAINING THIS POST AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS, DO NOT GO HARASSING MSQSIMS.** They, along with other TSR members were compromised during this incident but they have since been secured and the compromised mod I show below has been removed and (I assume by now, since they disallowed all TS4SCRIPT mods at the time) replaced with the safe, proper mod.\n\n>!What? My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye!

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**.

My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye! ITSUMI MALWARE in disguise! üëπ](https://preview.redd.it/f9ld0qn8njgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7aade09fdcfe4d98120f240b6594210171edbdf)\n\n[7-Zip can extract TS4SCRIPT files, huzzah!

If you're low, just hold on! Cause I will be your safety!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpsDamWdIM)\n\nI have adored Dido since her mainstream breakout with Eminem in the song [Stan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY). She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**. Don't !@#$ around, because you don't want to find out.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüß´ [‚ô™] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.\n\n**PLEASE, IN RESPECT OF THE TIME AND ENERGY I'VE PUT INTO MAINTAINING THIS POST AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS, DO NOT GO HARASSING MSQSIMS.** They, along with other TSR members were compromised during this incident but they have since been secured and the compromised mod I show below has been removed and (I assume by now, since they disallowed all TS4SCRIPT mods at the time) replaced with the safe, proper mod.\n\n>!What? My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye!

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh!

TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER.

My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye!

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower.

TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do.

One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised.

Since then we've had a couple other incidents too, *but shhhhh! 'Tis business as usual, don't cha kno'?!*\n\nMalicious users discovered what I refrained from talking about publicly for years - that our TS4SCRIPT files can be used maliciously against us. TS4SCRIPT files are wrappers for PYTHON scripts, and PYTHON programming code can be used maliciously.\n\nHow did I know this? A few years ago there was a spat between TURBODRIVER and another creator over content the other creator was making built on and using TURBO's code, and TURBO did something out of frustration they shouldn't have *and publicly apologized for it*, but it had the unintended effect of exposing what TS4SCRIPT files are capable of, and while the majority of the community probably doesn't even know this happened, I do. I was present and I paid attention. It's why I don't fully trust anyone and why I'm more than willing to üö© everyone and their virtual dog - *cats, unicorns and kaij≈´s get a pass*.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüëæ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwWm3om-gSw) IS CUTE BUT THE MALWARE IS TERRIFYING.\n\nRegardless what anyone else says, the malware was terrifying. If that !@#$ had spread through the simming community unchecked via our SECOND-PARTY mod hosters like CurseForge, The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims (all of whom were affected), there would have been !@#$ing tears.\n\nOn the Dark Web exists a place where anyone can purchase really !@#$ed up malware like they're over-the-counter drugs. One does not need to be a skilled programmer anymore to code malware, you can buy it like a pack o' Sour Skittles at the shady shop in the alley around the corner if you know where to find it (seriously, why are Sour Skittles so hard to find in my country and why are they so expensive?). This malware was so sophisticated that it likely came from there. Thank goodness the malicious user behind it kinda mucked up the delivery. TSR didn't even know they were compromised. If the malicious user hadn't !@#$ed up and tried to impersonate a known mod creator on Mod The Sims and got caught, !@#$ could've been bad.\n\nTears! MANY TEARS! I'm making funzies but I'm not joking. It had identifiers for AKIRA and functioned like REDLINE STEALER. I'll hotlink later. **Malicious hacker groups use malware like AKIRA and REDLINE STEALER to blackmail corporations and government agencies for L-L-LOADSAMONEY**. Don't !@#$ around, because you don't want to find out.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖüß´ [‚ô™] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.\n\n**PLEASE, IN RESPECT OF THE TIME AND ENERGY I'VE PUT INTO MAINTAINING THIS POST AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS, DO NOT GO HARASSING MSQSIMS.** They, along with other TSR members were compromised during this incident but they have since been secured and the compromised mod I show below has been removed and (I assume by now, since they disallowed all TS4SCRIPT mods at the time) replaced with the safe, proper mod.\n\n>!What? My claws haven't been dulled. I'll still throw shade at everyone involved for the abysmal way they all handled this incident and for the ridiculous complaints they made about members of the simming community sharing \"outdated information\" when they all dragged their feet in the comfort of Discord. I'm still me.!<\n\n[‚ô™ Look, look, see, see! It's a mod, but it's more than meets the eye!

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower.

She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower.

If you're low, just hold on! Cause I will be your safety!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpsDamWdIM)\n\nI have adored Dido since her mainstream breakout with Eminem in the song [Stan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY). She's the best thing the UK ever gave us! Don't get me wrong, Elton is a treasure, but Dido is Dido! ... Where were we? Oh yeah! üî¨\n\n# Here's where this gets complicated and why knowing this might not help nowadays.\n\nIf you know anything about PYTHON files, which I don't, there are two - PY is the raw, readable PYTHON script and PYC is the compiled PYTHON script. The only reason this incident unraveled as quickly as it did is because - \\[`SHOULD I EVEN BE SAYING ANY OF THIS?`\\] <clears throat> staying silent didn't help us before - is because the malicious user didn't compile the malicious script.\n\nI have very limited knowledge about PYTHON from my days of <clears throat> compiling World of Warcraft servers. Unfortunately, try as I did, I could not get the damned de-compiling plugin to work to decompile the compiled script you see above, though I believe that script is the legitimate mod and only the raw script is the malicious script and it was renamed the same in an attempt to obfuscate it's malicious intentions.\n\n[LEFT is malicious, RIGHT is likely MSQ's script. On Windows, Notepad or Notepad++ can open the raw PYTHON script. I just realized, this individual de-compiled MSQ's script. Where is the damn plugin they used?!](https://preview.redd.it/ir8awa3b7kgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0f84814c6c68adf7cb96aab7a02e84cb47dad)\n\nThe bit at the top that ends with `process.communicate()` is malicious. It creates an MS DOS .BAT batch script file with the `f.write` commands then executes it. The commands download a malicious file hosted on Discord which is then executed and infects your system, infects Discord, then proceeds to steal all of your login data and browser cookies, etc., etc., et cetera.\n\nAs I understand it, Discord was notified about this and they couldn't be arsed to do anything about it. Shall we see if the malicious file is still live on Discord's servers? Why not? I like living on the edge!\n\n[Well thank !@#$ it's finally gone. Pity. I never pass up the chance to drag Discord.](https://preview.redd.it/zh8gl1gnckgd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=282119aa94c9adedcf8843d49c8798b364ed59e9)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I OBFUSCATED THE NAME AND ICON OF THAT PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY.**\n\nThe program is free but the installer is shady as !@#$. IIRC, it installs or tries to install some !@#$ in the background. I have an old archived portable ZIP version of it that works and updates fine. The program works great, but I trust the company behind it about as much as I trust EA, which is not at all, so I don't want anyone downloading it then telling me they installed it and caught a malware.\n\nBack on topic...\n\n# The problem with asking me what to look for is this:\n\nThe next time someone tries this, they might be smarter about it. They might duplicate the code for the mod and shoehorn in the malicious code, so the mod works and the malware works, and maybe they compile the script so nosy simmers like me don't notice it so easily, and maybe they use a different type of malware that ModGuard doesn't work for, and maybe we don't catch it in time.\n\nAnd no, your premium anti-virus / anti-malware software isn't foolproof. Malware, like AV/AM software, is constantly evolving. Malware evolves to exploit vulnerabilities in software and circumvent AV/AM detection, and in response AV/AM evolves to detect sneaky malware, but that malware needs to be discovered first.\n\nSee why I'm not the person to tell you it's business as usual?\n\n# Now we arrive at the point where I throw shade.\n\n**Another thing we can look for as regular simmers is rogue TS4SCRIPT files** in mod .ZIP archives where they \"don't belong\", but who can say which TS4SCRIPT file doesn't belong in a .ZIP archive if it's a script mod with dozens of TS4SCRIPT files?\n\n**Another thing we can look for is inaccurate Modified Dates** for files in .ZIP archives that are more recent than the date the creator said the mod was updated or released. Some dates will be older because for those big script mods not all files always need updating, but the date on the most recent one that's been changed should match or be older than the date listed in the update notes or release notes. **If it don't match and it ain't older, it means something was altered and the archive was re-uploaded.**\n\nDuring the incident. the modding community was quick to highlight updated mods with no update notes from creators as possible üö©, then proceeded to upload minor updates for their mods without changing the version numbers or update notes and telling simmers (simmers defending creators also said this) \"it's fine because X creator uploaded it and they're trustworthy\"... like MSQSIMS is trustworthy, except their accounts were compromised, yeah?\n\nSee why I üö© this !@#$? >!We went from dragging our feet and lounging on Discord, to doing the same thing we were telling simmers to look out for and then being moody about it. Aca-scuse me?!<\n\nThere's the shade. Did you miss me?\n\nI actually had a simmer insinuate that MSQ is a nobody in some kinda argument against making people aware of what was happening back when it was happening. MSQ has almost 24.5 million downloads on their mods on TSR, and TSR, while I never much cared for it, is one of the oldest Sims websites in existence. My Mod The Sims profile is 16 years old, son / d√≥ttir. TSR is 8 years older than my MTS profile and 1 year older than Mod The Sims, and both of these websites are over 5 years older than Curse. C'mon now! Don't be this person.\n\nüöß I need a break and a shower. I live in the Caribbean and it's a sauna.\n\n# ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÜ‚ãÖü¶Ñ [\\[‚ô™\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TO48Cnl66w) THANK YOU! SINCERELY.\n\n*No, not you, Reddit.

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7. Section: `chttpd` Name: `max_http_request_size` Value: `4294967296`\n8. Section: `couchdb` Name: `max_document_size` Value: `50000000`\n9. Section: `cors` Name: `credentials` Value: `true`\n10. Section: `cors` Name: `origins` Value: `app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,`[`http://localhost`](http://localhost)\n\n# Obsidian - Windows 11 Client\n\n1. Download and install the Windows 11 Obsidian client from [here.](https://obsidian.md/download)\n2. Once installed, open Obsidian.\n3. Next to `Create new vault` click the `Create` button next.\n4. In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20. On the top menu, under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 5th button with the üîÑ refresh icon.\n21. Next to `Sync mode` select `LiveSync` from the drop down menu.\n22. You can close the `settings` windows out, on the top right of the notes you should see `Sync: zZz` which means everything is working properly and the sync is in standby mode until you start typing something.\n23. Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels. You will definitely need to if you plan on using mobile devices as they require HTTPS.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nHope this gets you up and running. As you get more familiar with the app, you will unlock just how great Obsidian is. Happy to answer any questions.",

This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20.

        "answer_text": "Every now and then, there is something great in this sub...\n\n**Thanks for sharing! Never bothered much with Obsidian and had no real need for it, playing with this setup a bit now.**\n\nI only wish that the dev of the livesync plugin had chosen a different db, so we could properly \"automate\" this entire setup for deployment, i do not like having compose stacks where i have to deploy a part of it, then take manual config steps to then continue with the rest of the setup. I enjoy setting as much as possible up for \"one-click\" deployment. With databases like MariaDB, Postgres etc that is easily possible with init scripts to \"pre-populate\" the db etc. But i understand that couchdb is a bit different, and i am sure the dev has very good reasons for chosing it over other things and im not a dev myself so i have no clue about the details. Its just one thing that irks (?) me about this whole setup, thats all. But once this is done, its fantastic and amazing job by that dev. *(Just noticed that object storage ala S3 is supported as alternative, experimental tho, i might give that route a try to have a complete stack without manual steps)*\n\n#Dont forget to star them on GitHub.\n\nQuick small addition:\n\nI dislike running **containers without healthchecks**, especially when its a database (couchdb here). Thankfully couchdb provides a proper API endpoint for its status, so simply adding this to the compose for it works:\n\n    healthcheck:\n      test: curl --fail -s http://localhost:5984/_up | grep -Eo '\\\"status\\\":\\\"ok\\\"' || exit 1\n      start_period: 60s\n      interval: 30s\n      timeout: 10s\n      retries: 3\n\n*(That regex is god awful i know, but i hate regex with a passion and i gave up trying to learn it, please dont waste your time trying to explain it to me, it works, good enough for me...cough)*\n\nUnfortuntely, Linuxserver/KasmVNC does not provide a similar useful endpoint, but at least curl exists in their image so we can check if the webserver is up and responding correctly, or not:\n\n    healthcheck:\n      test: \"curl --fail -s http://localhost:3000/ || exit 1\"\n      start_period: 60s\n      interval: 30s\n      timeout: 10s\n      retries: 3\n\n*(I would suggest to modify the specific values for both checks to suit your own setup and taste, like interval etc)*\n\nWith those two checks added in compose, you can then also use \"depends_on\" with a condition for healthy. So basically, the obsidian container will depend on the db container being in a healthy state, otherwise obsidian will stop and wait for db to become healthy again. Or on startup of the whole stack, the obsidian container will wait until the db is actually up and ready, and only then will it start itself. This will likely increase your entire startup time, but its the \"proper\" way to do things like that to avoid issues. And honestly, paying the price of a few seconds wasted startup time for a stack that then runs nearly 24/7 and to have less issues, fair price to pay. But im sure some people will disagree, to each their own.\n\nYou can achieve this by simply adding this section to the obsidian service in compose:\n\n    depends_on:\n      obsidian-couchdb:\n        condition: service_healthy\n\n*(Replace obsidian-couchdb with the correct container name)*",

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7. Section: `chttpd` Name: `max_http_request_size` Value: `4294967296`\n8. Section: `couchdb` Name: `max_document_size` Value: `50000000`\n9. Section: `cors` Name: `credentials` Value: `true`\n10. Section: `cors` Name: `origins` Value: `app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,`[`http://localhost`](http://localhost)\n\n# Obsidian - Windows 11 Client\n\n1. Download and install the Windows 11 Obsidian client from [here.](https://obsidian.md/download)\n2. Once installed, open Obsidian.\n3. Next to `Create new vault` click the `Create` button next.\n4. In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17.

Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels.

So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7. Section: `chttpd` Name: `max_http_request_size` Value: `4294967296`\n8. Section: `couchdb` Name: `max_document_size` Value: `50000000`\n9. Section: `cors` Name: `credentials` Value: `true`\n10. Section: `cors` Name: `origins` Value: `app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,`[`http://localhost`](http://localhost)\n\n# Obsidian - Windows 11 Client\n\n1. Download and install the Windows 11 Obsidian client from [here.](https://obsidian.md/download)\n2. Once installed, open Obsidian.\n3. Next to `Create new vault` click the `Create` button next.\n4. In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20. On the top menu, under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 5th button with the üîÑ refresh icon.\n21. Next to `Sync mode` select `LiveSync` from the drop down menu.\n22. You can close the `settings` windows out, on the top right of the notes you should see `Sync: zZz` which means everything is working properly and the sync is in standby mode until you start typing something.\n23. Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels. You will definitely need to if you plan on using mobile devices as they require HTTPS.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nHope this gets you up and running. As you get more familiar with the app, you will unlock just how great Obsidian is. Happy to answer any questions.",

Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2.

In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20. On the top menu, under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 5th button with the üîÑ refresh icon.\n21. Next to `Sync mode` select `LiveSync` from the drop down menu.\n22. You can close the `settings` windows out, on the top right of the notes you should see `Sync: zZz` which means everything is working properly and the sync is in standby mode until you start typing something.\n23. Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels.

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running.

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7.

        "answer_text": "> I‚Äôve also struggle understanding Regex‚Ä¶ till this day I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. That along with YAML automations in Home Assistant, thankfully I discovered PyScript allowing me to do write automations in Python. It‚Äôs truly opened new possibilities for complex automations for me. But I digress. \n\nI actually enjoy YAML, it seems quite basic and logical to me. Sure it has a few unique weird quirks, but once i was aware of those, i have no issues with it. But i know there are a bunch of \"YAML haters\" out there and they have their reasons, fine.\n\nRegex is simply not compatible with my brain, other things i can understand and learn relatively quick. But regex i tried so many times over the years, nah, im simply too dumb for that, and thats okay.\n\n> Back to your point, I use UptimeKuma to track my docker containers\n\nBut Kuma only checks if a container is up or down, right? It cant tell you if a database is actually working correctly or anything like this. Same for a container that provides some kind of interface through a webserver. Just because it responds to a \"ping\" check doesnt mean the actual service that it provides is working correctly. Which is why essential things should have a proper endpoint for the health/status info which can be then queried by other tools. Either directly by Kuma (but that would require Kuma to directly access the the port of that service, not always ideal/possible), or by something more direct like a Docker healthcheck. That way Docker itself checks on the status of that service and marks the container as healthy or unhealthy accordingly, then Kuma can interpret this status and react to it with a notification to you etc.\n\nIn addition, when using containers with HA (high availability), healthchecks are very essential. I wish more devs would add them \"out of the box\", but since most of these typical projects around here are non-commercial and done by talented people in their spare time and provided for free, i cant really complain at all, its not hard to add a custom healthcheck through compose (as long as tools like curl/wget/etc exist in the image...)\n\n> with Dozzle for logs which I check a few times a month to make sure there are no underlying problems\n\nDozzle is neat, no doubt.\n\nBut checking logs every few months is of course very different to have a near instant status change when something is wrong.\n\n> Thank you for this sir, you get an upvote from me.\n\nNp, have a nice weekend.",

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was. It's not open source but I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen I ran into the roadblock of syncing my notes between devices, which Obsidian does offer a service called Obsidian Sync for $4 a month but I wanted to self-host this aspect, I didn't want to rely on someone else (personal preference). *If you don't want to self-host the syncing I highly recommend you support the company by using their sync service.*\n\nI was recommended a plugin for Obsidian called [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) which allows you to self-host the syncing process. Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7. Section: `chttpd` Name: `max_http_request_size` Value: `4294967296`\n8. Section: `couchdb` Name: `max_document_size` Value: `50000000`\n9. Section: `cors` Name: `credentials` Value: `true`\n10. Section: `cors` Name: `origins` Value: `app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,`[`http://localhost`](http://localhost)\n\n# Obsidian - Windows 11 Client\n\n1. Download and install the Windows 11 Obsidian client from [here.](https://obsidian.md/download)\n2. Once installed, open Obsidian.\n3. Next to `Create new vault` click the `Create` button next.\n4. In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20. On the top menu, under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 5th button with the üîÑ refresh icon.\n21. Next to `Sync mode` select `LiveSync` from the drop down menu.\n22. You can close the `settings` windows out, on the top right of the notes you should see `Sync: zZz` which means everything is working properly and the sync is in standby mode until you start typing something.\n23. Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels. You will definitely need to if you plan on using mobile devices as they require HTTPS.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nHope this gets you up and running. As you get more familiar with the app, you will unlock just how great Obsidian is. Happy to answer any questions.",
        "answer_text": "If you use Tasker (or some other automation app) you can set syncthing to start when you have obsidian (or any other app you want to sync) open and stop once you close it.\n\nWorks great for me, I can paste the tasker task if you're interested\n\nEDIT:\nHere is the tasker task exported as xml:\n```\n<TaskerData sr=\"\" dvi=\"1\" tv=\"6.3.13\">\n\t<Task sr=\"task23\">\n\t\t<cdate>1718007584225</cdate>\n\t\t<edate>1723340272552</edate>\n\t\t<id>23</id>\n\t\t<nme>Start Syncthing</nme>\n\t\t<pri>100</pri>\n\t\t<Action sr=\"act0\" ve=\"7\">\n\t\t\t<code>877</code>\n\t\t\t<label>start syncthing</label>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg0\" ve=\"3\">com.nutomic.syncthingandroid.action.START</Str>\n\t\t\t<Int sr=\"arg1\" val=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg2\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg3\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg4\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg5\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg6\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg7\" ve=\"3\">com.nutomic.syncthingandroid</Str>\n\t\t\t<Str sr=\"arg8\" ve=\"3\"/>\n\t\t\t<Int sr=\"arg9\" val=\"0\"/>\n\t\t</Action>\n\t</Task>\n</TaskerData>\n```\n\nNot sure how helpful that is, but the key point is make a 'Send Intent' task. You want to set the action as `com.nutomic.syncthingandroid.action.START` and make sure you set the package as `com.nutomic.syncthingandroid`. You'll want to make another task for stopping syncthing, which should have the same settings as above, except change the end of the intent to .STOP. \n\nThen just link it up to a profile that is triggered by obsidian being open. Make sure you link the 'start syncthing' task to the open action and the 'stop syncthing' task to the close action.",

Below is a detailed guide on how to set this up.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis \"service\" has 3 moving parts to it. The Obsidian app, the LiveSync plugin and the CouchDB database in a docker container. Here is a breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Obsidian app:** You install the app on each device. I use it on an iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 11 desktop and a web client (docker container from [Linuxserver](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-obsidian/)). Each device has a local copy of your notes so you can still use it offline.\n2. **CouchDB:** This is where a copy of your notes will be stored (encryption is an option and also recommended).\n3. **LiveSync plugin:** The plugin is what does all the heavy lifting of syncing all your devices. It accomplishes this by connecting to your self-hosted CouchDB docker container and storing an encrypted copy there. All your other devices will connect to the database to grab the updated notes allowing for an instant sync.\n\n# Docker Compose on Unraid\n\nBelow is the docker compose file just to get CouchDB up and running. I installed this on an Unraid server so you can edit the labels and environment variables for your specific OS.\n\n      couchdb-obsidian-livesync:\n        container_name: obsidian-livesync #shortened name\n        image: couchdb:3.3.3\n        environment:\n          - PUID=99\n          - PGID=100\n          - UMASK=0022\n          - TZ=America/New_York\n          - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user # optionally change me\n          - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # definitly change me\n        volumes:\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/data:/opt/couchdb/data\n          - /mnt/user/appdata/couchdb-obsidian-livesync/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d\n        ports:\n          - \"5984:5984\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        labels:\n          - net.unraid.docker.webui=http://[IP]:[PORT:5984]/_utils # for some reason this does not work properly\n          - net.unraid.docker.icon=https://couchdb.apache.org/image/couch@2x.png\n          - net.unraid.docker.shell=bash\n\n# CouchDB - Initial Configuration\n\n1. Go to the CouchDB admin page by going here: [`http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils`](http://192.168.1.0:5984/_utils) make sure to use your server's IP address.\n2. Login using the credentials you set in the Docker compose file.\n3. Click on the `<->` icon on the top left, it will expand the menu from simple icons to icons with text which will make following this guide easier.\n4. Click on `Setup` on the left menu.\n5. Click on `Configure as Single Node` and enter the same credentials from the Docker compose file into the `Specify your Admin credentials` fields.\n6. Leave everything else the same and click `Configure Node`.\n\n# CouchDB - Verify Installation\n\n1. Let's verify the CouchDB installation by clicking `Verify` on the left menu.\n2. Click `Verify Installation` and if everything is good, a popup banner should popup saying `Success! Your CouchDB installation is working. Time to Relax.` along with 6 check marks next to each item in the table.\n\n# CouchDB - Create Database\n\n1. Click on the `Databases` on the left menu.\n2. Click on `Create Database` on the top right.\n3. Under `Database Name` enter `obsidiandb`, or whatever you like. Advice: if you intend to use this setup for multiple users, each user will need their own database, so I recommend naming the database to include the user's first name like: `obsidiandb_john` or `obsidiandb_jane` just to make it easier in the future.\n4. Under `Partitioning` select `Non-partitioned - recommended for most workloads`. Once the database is created, you should be redirected to the new database's config page. You don't have to do anything here.\n\n# CouchDB - Configuration\n\n1. Click on `Configuration` on the left main menu. The following 9 config entries are what the script was intended to do automatically but I wanted to do it manually. Click on `+ Add Option` on the top right for each entry:\n2. Section: `chttpd` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n3. Section: `chttpd_auth` Name: `require_valid_user` Value: `true`\n4. Section: `httpd` Name: `WWW-Authenticate` Value: `Basic realm=\"couchdb\"`\n5. Section: `httpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n6. Section: `chttpd` Name: `enable_cors` Value: `true`\n7. Section: `chttpd` Name: `max_http_request_size` Value: `4294967296`\n8. Section: `couchdb` Name: `max_document_size` Value: `50000000`\n9. Section: `cors` Name: `credentials` Value: `true`\n10. Section: `cors` Name: `origins` Value: `app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,`[`http://localhost`](http://localhost)\n\n# Obsidian - Windows 11 Client\n\n1. Download and install the Windows 11 Obsidian client from [here.](https://obsidian.md/download)\n2. Once installed, open Obsidian.\n3. Next to `Create new vault` click the `Create` button next.\n4. In the `Vault name` field, name your Vault whatever you like, I simply named mine `Vault`. You can think of a vault as a \"master folder\" that contains all your folders and notes. Some users have different vaults for different aspects of their lives, such as `Work` or `Personal` but I keep everything under one vault for ease of use.\n5. Next setting is `Location`, click `Browse`. This is where your vault will be locally saved. I created an `Obsidian` folder in the `Documents` folder but you can put it anywhere you like.\n6. Click `Create` and Obsidian should open up to your newly created vault with 3 window panes. Next step is to setup the LiveSync plugin.\n\n# Obsidian - LiveSync Plugin\n\n1. Click on `options` button (sprocket icon) on the bottom left area.\n2. Click `Community plugins` and click on the `Turn on community plugins` button after reading the risk disclosure.\n3. Next to `Community plugins` click on the `Browse` button.\n4. Search for `Self-hosted LiveSync`.\n5. Only 1 plugin should show up and that's the one by `voratamoroz`, click on it.\n6. Click the `Install` button and let it install.\n7. Click the `Enable` button.\n8. Click `Open setting dialog` button.\n9. Click `Options` button.\n10. Under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 4th button with the üõ∞Ô∏è satellite icon.\n11. This is where we will enter the self-hosted CouchDB details. Next to `Remote Type` make sure `CouchDB` is selected from the drop down menu.\n12. In the `URI` field type [`http://192.168.1.0:5984`](http://192.168.1.0:5984) make sure to change to your server IP and port.\n13. In the `Username` field type `osidian_user` or whatever you used in the docker compose.\n14. Same for `Password` field.\n15. In the `Database name` field type `obsidiandb` or whatever you named your database earlier in CouchDB.\n16. Click the `Test` button to test the connection to the CouchDB database. Assuming everything is working properly a text popup should say `Connected to obsidiandb successfully`.\n17. Click the `Check` button to confirm the database was configured properly, there should be a purple checkmark next to each line item. If not, there should be a `Fix` button next to the item that you can click for it to either create or correct for you, but I prefer to manually do it myself.\n18. Assuming everything is good up to this point, click the `Apply` button next to `Apply Settings`.\n19. **Optional but recommended:** scroll down to the `End-to-end encryption` and toggle it on and set a passphrase. Please remember this passphrase as all your other devices must have matching passphrases for it to be able to decrypt your notes. Click the red button `Just apply`.\n20. On the top menu, under `Settings for Self-hosted LiveSync.` you should see a row of 8 buttons, click on the 5th button with the üîÑ refresh icon.\n21. Next to `Sync mode` select `LiveSync` from the drop down menu.\n22. You can close the `settings` windows out, on the top right of the notes you should see `Sync: zZz` which means everything is working properly and the sync is in standby mode until you start typing something.\n23. Repeat the above instructions for all other devices.\n\n# **Reverse Proxy**\n\nI highly recommend putting this behind at least a reverse proxy, I use Nginx Proxy Manager in conjunction with Cloudflare Tunnels. You will definitely need to if you plan on using mobile devices as they require HTTPS.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nHope this gets you up and running. As you get more familiar with the app, you will unlock just how great Obsidian is. Happy to answer any questions.",
        "answer_text": "The git plugin supports mobile. You have to add an access token from Github, and it will push/pull automatically. I like the git plugin more than the sync solutions now. If a conflict happens (haven't happened yet) I am more comfortable resolving it in git.",

        "question_text": "Guide: Obsidian with free, self-hosted, instant sync\n\n**TLDR**: I've been using Obsidian with the [LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) plugin by [vrtmrz](https://github.com/vrtmrz) for over a month now and not counting the Arr stack, this plugin is without a doubt, the single-best self-hosted service that I run on my server. I use it multiple times a day and at this point I can't live without it. So I decided to contribute back to the community, which has taught me so much, by sharing my experience and also writing a detailed guide. I found that most guides gloss over crucial steps, but then again I rarely know what I'm doing, so take my guide with a pinch of salt.\n\n# Story time\n\nI recently went on a journey of trying to find a replacement to Apple Notes which I documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I was looking for something that checked the following boxes:\n\n1. Able to self-host on my Unraid server.\n2. Must have an iOS app, not something accessed in a browser.\n3. Sync my notes between all my devices instantly and seamlessly.\n\nOn this wonderful sub-Reddit, Obsidian was constantly recommended. So I downloaded both the Windows 11 app on my desktop and the iOS app on my iPhone, and was extremely pleased how polished it was.

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI.

It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy.

It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

        "question_text": "A List of CharacterAI Alternatives\n\n6/20/2024 edit: I'm aware that this list isn't currently up to date. I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content.

Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application.

        "question_text": "A List of CharacterAI Alternatives\n\n6/20/2024 edit: I'm aware that this list isn't currently up to date. I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon.

And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories.

It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI.

It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI.

It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",

I'm planning to update it sometime soon, but as of this edit, the list is not fully up to date. Still, feel free to comment about any alternatives that you think deserve a mention. I will emphasize, though, that I try to only mention applications that I feel have a genuine niche. If I find an alternative that I don't feel is worth using over other options, it's liable to be excluded from the list.\n\nThis is a trimmed version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/10w4oh2/the_updated_list_of_alternatives/) that I posted over on r/AIDungeon. That list, itself, is an updated version of [a list of AI Dungeon alternatives](https://np.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/nsc8yf/the_list_of_alternatives/) made over a year earlier by u/Ratdog98. And yes, I'm aware of [the list of CAI alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAi_NSFW/comments/zj7ivz/cai_alternatives_both_sfw_nsfw/) posted by u/Sannibunn1984. However, that list is no longer being updated, it's missing some alternatives that I mention here, and the info about Replika is outdated (even with a subscription, Replika no longer allows NSFW content).\n\nIt still might be worth checking out that list, though, as it includes some applications that aren't on this list. This is because I'm simply not knowledgeable enough about said applications to write a good description of them. And also, the list of AI Dungeon alternatives that I posted includes some interesting applications that might be worth checking out. However, I tried to trim this list down to only the applications that might be worth using as chatbots. This also means that this list primarily consists of AI writing assistant applications and dedicated AI chatbot applications.\n\nThis is broken into 3 main sections:\n\n* Paid Alternatives\n\n* Free Alternatives\n\n* Cost Comparison\n\nAdditionally, the free section (not the paid section) will be divided into 3 subsections:\n\n* General Alternatives*\n\n* Censored Alternatives\n\n* PC-only Alternatives\n\n*By \"General\" alternatives, I just mean alternatives that do not fit into any of the other 2 categories. Essentially, alternatives that aren't censored and that aren't exclusive to PC.\n\nI hope you enjoy the list, and that you might find some utility in it.\n\n#***Paid Alternatives***\n\n---\n\n##**NovelAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (compatible with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\n**Price: $10/$15/$25 per month (Has 100 output free trial; 50 outputs before making an account, 50 more after making an account)**\n\nThis is definitely one of the most popular uncensored AI writing applications at the moment. It has a lot of advanced features implemented as well. It also has image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It has a currency called \"Anlas\" that are used for training modules and generating images.\n\nIn terms of costs, NovelAi has a three-tier monthly subscription system. For $10, you get 1000 max (tier 10) priority actions per week -- if you exceed that, you get 100 actions at the next tier down until you reach one. This means that your actions may take longer to compute after you use your 1000. The largest model available for this subscription tier is Euterpe; a finetuned version of Fairseq-13B. You also get 1000 Anlas per month. For $15, you get access to a larger context (2048 tokens instead of 1024) which means the AI will remember more of your previous inputs. For $25, you get unlimited max priority actions and access to the Krake model (a finetuned version of GPT-NeoX), as well as early access to experimental features. You also get 10000 Anlas per month and unlimited normal and small sized generations (NAI defines this as \"images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image. Does not include img2img generations.\") with the image generator.\n\nSome more notable features:\n\n* Text is color-coded to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.\n\n* It shows which entries from the Lorebook have been activated (Short explanation of the Lorebook for those unaware: it allows users to write an entry, along with keywords for said entry. When a keyword is used in the story, the contents of the entry will be added to the AI's context for the next few outputs. A similar feature can be found on applications like HoloAI, KoboldAI, and AI Dungeon.)\n\n* It also has a great amount of customization options in the form of themes.\n\n* It has text-to-speech.\n\n* It has \"hypebots\" which can comment on events in your stories. If you ever played AI Dungeon back when AID had scoring bots, they're basically those; just without the scoring system.\n\n* Website: https://novelai.net/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/VzpJspczD5\n\n* Subreddit: r/NovelAI\n\n##**HoloAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $5/$8/$12 per month (Has 8000 character free trial).**\n\nHoloAI is a program that runs select AI models inside a cleaned-up browser interface. They have taken into account privacy needs and have encrypted saving/loading. I'd say it's most comparable to NovelAI, and as with NovelAI, HoloAI offers multiple models for users; although $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B. Users who pay $12 per month get access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX and base Fairseq-13B.\n\nAs for cost, HoloAI has two systems of payment: a subscription, or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month sub for 500,000 characters, or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free-trial of 8000 characters to test out the service before you purchase. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account. Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX.\n\nIt also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the devs are apparently looking for people to take over the project.\n\nSome other notable features:\n\n* Users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times.\n\n* The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400.\n\n* Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing you to restore former versions of your works or copy them.\n\n* Website: https://writeholo.com/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/gnqxm9uFjv\n\n* Subreddit: /r/HoloAI\n\n##**Sudowrite**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: $19/$29/$129 per month if you pay monthly, $10/$20/$100 per month if you pay yearly (Has free trial)**\n\nSudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, and is the only GPT-3 Davinci application I know of that *isn't* heavily censored. It is *technically* filtered, but only to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, so most users shouldn't have any issues. Although, it's worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and it's possible that false flags might be an issue. It has three subscription tiers: \"Hobby & Student\", \"Professional\", and \"Max\", with those tiers allowing users to generate 30k, 90k, and 300k words per month, respectively.\n\n\nOverall, Sudowrite is definitely on the expensive side. And unfortunately, it's also lacking some features that are common among the other alternatives on this list (for example, no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned). Although, it still has some interesting features (it has options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc.; it also generates multiple outputs at a time).\n\n\nNote: Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. For my phone, it only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode, but having to use desktop mode still isn't ideal. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets (I can't confirm since I don't own a tablet).\n\n* Website: https://www.sudowrite.com/\n\n##**OpenAI Playground**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Pay per token; pricing depends on model used (Has free trial)**\n\nThe OpenAI Playground allows access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. New users get a free $18 worth of tokens that they can use within 3 months of registering.\n\n**Important note: The OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered; you can get the AI to generate anything. However, you can supposedly still get banned for violating OpenAI's [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy). Bans don't seem very common from what I've heard, but it's something to be aware of, especially given that you need a phone number to make an account, thus meaning that making an alt account isn't as easy as with other applications.**  \n\n* Website: https://platform.openai.com/playground\n\n##**ChatFAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$9/$29/$59 per month or $99/$290/$590 per year if paying yearly**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Chai in terms of feature set and business model. It has basically the same features as Chai. It has a free tier that allows up to 100 messages per month, and up to 4 ongoing chats, along with 3 subscription tiers.\n\nAll subscriptions allow you to create custom characters. The Basic tier allows up to 1500 messages per month, and allows 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows up to 5000 messages per month, and allows 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and 50 ongoing chats.\n\nAs for what makes it worth considering over Chai, it apparently uses much larger AI models. The dev hasn't specified which models, though, just said that they're 100B+ parameter models. Theoretically, it should be pretty good in terms of output quality (Note: I said *theoretically* because I don't have a ton of experience with it due to how limited the free tier is, so I can't personally vouch for the quality of the outputs). However, it *is* expensive.\n\n* Website: https://chatfai.com/\n\n---\n\n#***Free Alternatives***\n\n#*Free/General*\n\n---\n\n##**KoboldAI**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant (Compatible with Pygmalion models for more chatbot-like outputs and with TavernAI for a more CharacterAI-esque UI and feature set)**\n\nKoboldAI can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. It definitely has the most features of any free alternative that I'm aware of (including multiplayer; I don't know of any other alternatives with multiplayer). With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX. As for KoboldAI Lite, the models just depend on whatever the volunteers are providing.\n\nNote: Running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC. Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile, though.\n\n* KoboldAI Client: https://koboldai.org/\n\n* KoboldAI TPU Edition Google Colab: https://koboldai.org/colab/\n\n* KoboldAI GPU Edition Google Colab (older Colab version with weaker models): https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb\n\n* KoboldAI Lite: https://lite.koboldai.net/\n\n* Subreddit: /r/KoboldAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UCyXV7NssH\n\n##**Dreamily**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is the only AI writing application on this list with a proper mobile app. It uses an unknown AI model, but a developer said at one point that it used a model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B (although that info could very well be outdated; that was said well over a year ago). Regardless, the outputs seem fairly decent for a free alternative. It also has a selection of different finetuned models to use, along with the option to train custom models (although that functionality is limited at the moment). It also generates multiple outputs at once.\n\nThere are two versions of the service: an English option, and a Chinese version, which requires an account to sign-in and is apparently much stricter on its output monitoring. Links to both are included, along with a disclaimer.\n\n* Website (English version): https://dreamily.ai/\n\n* Website (Chinese version -- REQUIRES LOGIN and STRICT MONITORING): http://if.caiyunai.com/dream/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/esDncB8zbH\n\n* Subreddit: r/DreamilyAI\n\n##**TextSynth**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/Pay per token**\n\nThis website allows free, uncensored access to GPT-J 6B (plus a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French), Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B (an AI model meant for translations). It also has Stable Diffusion, but that's not uncensored. For free users, there's a rate limit and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. You can also pay per token (pricing depends on which AI model you use), which removes the rate limit and output length limit. It's lacking in features, though.\n\n* TextSynth Playground: https://textsynth.com/playground.html\n\n\n##**Inferkit**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\n**Price: Free/$20/$60 per month**\n\nThis describes itself as \"a web interface and API for AI-based text generators\" usable by both novelists and app developers alike, and the AI model used is Megatron-11B. It has a free option that allows you to generate 10000 characters per week. $20 subscribers get 600k monthly characters and $60 subscribers get 2.5 million monthly characters. With that said, I don't feel that it's worth paying for over the other paid alternatives. It may be worth trying for free users, though. Worth noting is that there's no in-program or online saving function built in; thus, it has neither a filter nor any ability for the contents to be leaked. Just make sure to save your outputs, if you do decide to use it.\n\nNote: The original List of AI Dungeon Alternatives that this list is based upon noted that some have experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment. Unsure if that's still an issue, but it's something you should be aware of.\n\n* Website: https://inferkit.com/\n\n##**Pygmalion**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThe Pygmalion AI models were made with the intention of being an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT. So, they're primarily meant to be used as chatbots. Overall, the models seem pretty decent. They're also compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI.\n\nNote: There was a Google Colab for Pygmalion, but it was taken offline. If you want to use the Pygmalion models without running them locally, your current options are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.\n\n* Pygmalion Guide & FAQ: https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai\n\n* HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI\n\n* Subreddit: r/PygmalionAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq\n\n##**Chai**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$12/$30 per month**\n\nChai is a chatbot application that I'd say is most comparable to CharacterAI. It uses GPT-J 6B and, for $30 subscribers, Fairseq-13B. It allows for the creation and customization of bots to chat with. However, for free users, usage is limited and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets. How many messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random; I've gotten 50 messages that took 1 hour to reset, 70 messages that took 4 hours, 30 messages that took over an hour, etc. Worth noting is that only your inputs use up messages. If you send 1 message, and then retry the AI's output 10 times, it'll count as only having used 1 message.\n\nIt's available on the Google Play Store and App Store and has a web version; although the web version seem to be lacking some features of the app versions. Users can also upload bots, and there's a page to find bots other users have uploaded. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, and $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B. Although, I'm personally not sure that a Chai subscription is worthwhile. For a lower price, you could purchase a NovelAI subscription, and optionally, use TavernAI as a frontend for it if you want a UI and features more similar to those of CharacterAI. This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription (although, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup).\n\n**Important note: Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it's very important to *not* put personal info in your Chai conversations (you should already avoid inputting personal info into any AI application that isn't locally run due to the possibility of data breaches and the companies behind the applications generally being able to read private content, but this is especially important with Chai). If you want your conversations to be private, make your own bots.**\n\n* Website: https://chai.ml/\n\n* Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chai-chat-with-ai-bots/id1544750895\n\n* Subreddit: r/ChaiApp\n\n##**AgnAIstic**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nAgnAIstic is essentially an online frontend for using other AI models with a Chatbot-esque UI. It's apparently compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde.\n\n* Website: https://agnai.chat/\n\n* Github: htthttps://github.com/luminai-companion/agn-ai\n\n##**AnimaAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**Price: Free/$10 per month/$40 per year/$70 lifetime subscription**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application that I'd say is most similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. It allows you to create and train an AI to chat with, with the AI being represented by a customizable 3D avatar (although the bulk of the cosmetic customization options are locked behind a subscription). The \"romantic partners\" status (and along with it, NSFW content) is also locked behind a subscription. A subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.\n\nOverall, if you want something similar to Replika, this might be worth considering. I'm not sure I'd recommend a monthly subscription, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are both pretty cheap in the long run in comparison to the other applications on the list.\n\n* Website: https://myanima.ai/\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=anima.virtual.ai.robot.friend&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anima-ai-friend-chat-bot/id1537239242\n\n* Subreddit: r/AnimaAI/\n\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/146705341009086\n\n##**Nastia**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is a pretty new AI chatbot application that seems to be pretty obscure at the moment. I'd say its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika. I can't seem to find any info on what AI model it uses, but for what it's worth, the output quality seems pretty decent from my testing.\n\nWorth noting is that, although it's currently entirely free, the website implies that the application will be monetized some time in the future. Additionally, although it doesn't currently have a mobile app, a mobile app is planned.\n\n* Website: https://www.nastia.ai/\n\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Nv52Bk8qEk\n\n#*Free/Censored*\n\n---\n\n##**ChatGPT**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nThis is an AI chatbot application made by OpenAI. Since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's content filter to enforce their [content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/content-policy) and is also not exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for giving pretty good outputs, especially for a free application.\n\n* Website: https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\n##**Poe**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\nPoe is an AI chatbot application made by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The outputs seem good, although it's heavily censored.\n\n* Website: https://poe.com/\n\n##**Pirr**\n\n**Category: Writing assistant**\n\nThis is an AI writing assistant that seems to be specifically advertised to generate erotica. It seems *okay* in terms of output quality from my testing. However, it disallows violence, humiliation, racism, incest, underage characters, noncon, and abuse. Possibly other things as well. *And* it seems to just use a simple regex filter, meaning that false positives are not exactly uncommon.\n\n* Website: https://pirr.app/\n\n##**Replika**\n\n**Category: Chatbot**\n\n**(Free/$70 annually + microtransactions)**\n\nReplika is an application designed to act as an AI chat companion of sorts. It uses GPT-3 to generate text, and it allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. It has PC, iOS, and Android options.\n\nNote: If you've heard of Replika but haven't been keeping up with the updates to Replika, you may have heard that NSFW content was possible, but just locked behind a Replika Pro subscription. Replika *used* to allow NSFW content for paid users, but the developers recently removed NSFW content soon after they began having legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency as a result of the lack of safeguards to prevent minors being exposed to inappropriate content. I (and some others) assumed this would just be a temporary solution to said legal issues, but more recently the devs have said that NSFW content *is not* coming back.\n\nSome users have reported the censorship negatively affecting intimate roleplay with the AI; not just NSFW content. And as a fair warning, Luka, the company behind Replika, is just... not exactly a great company. Even outside of their current controversy due to the removal of NSFW content, they've never exactly been good at simply being upfront and honest with their community.\n\n* Website: https://replika.ai/\n\n* App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1158555867\n\n* Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app\n\n* Web Version: https://my.replika.ai/\n\n* Subreddit: r/Replika\n\n#*Free/PC-only*\n\n---\n\n##**TavernAI**\n\n**Category: Chatbot/Frontend**\n\nTavernAI is a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. It's intended to replicate the UI and features of CharacterAI. You can also import CAI chats into TavernAI.\n\n* Github: https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI\n\n* Discord: https://discord.gg/zmK2gmr45t\n\n---\n\n#***Cost Comparison***\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer: This section is based on my own experiences with the paid alternatives and my opinions on said alternatives, and my opinions are, of course, subjective.**\n\nAs far as the writing applications go, NovelAI is likely the best value. Relatively affordable with a lot of features and fairly solid AI models. HoloAI is cheaper (its subscription tiers are only about half the price of their NAI counterparts), but is generally worse than NAI in most other aspects. And additionally, KoboldAI has come far enough in the past year or so that I feel that it's actually arguably better than HoloAI at this point. As such, I'd recommend that people considering HoloAI try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.\n\nSudowrite, in my experience, gives the best outputs of any AI writing application that isn't heavily censored. Plus, it has some pretty neat features that you don't really see in the other alternatives on this list. However, it's relatively expensive (especially if you pay monthly rather than yearly), you can't get unlimited use, and it's missing some features that are common among the other alternatives.\n\nInferkit, in my opinion, just isn't worth paying for at this point. If you're willing to pay $20+ per month, you're probably better off just using one of the other paid options. It may be worth using as a free user, though.\n\nI've already given my thoughts on Chai's subscriptions; I personally feel that the AI models available are simply not good enough to justify paying $12/$30 per month when the other alternatives exist. As for ChatFAI, it should give pretty good outputs, but it's also easily the most expensive chatbot application on this list.\n\n\nAs for AnimaAI, I'm not quite sure it's worth paying $10 per month for. However, if you pay yearly, it's essentially $3.33 per month; cheaper than any other subscriptions on this list. And as long as AnimaAI continues to exist for at least 2 more years, the lifetime subscription is even cheaper in the long run than the yearly subscription.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**If you have any questions, or if you've heard of any alternatives that aren't on the list (or are making one), let me know. And if you're suggesting an application to be added to the list, please include any info that you think is important to know about the application. Additionally, please tell me if there's any outdated or incorrect information, or if any of the links are broken.**\n\n\n**On an aside, I am evaluating the applications that are on u/Sannibunn1984's list of CAI alternatives, that aren't on this list. However, I'd like more info on them and opinions on their quality. Some of them seem to lack info that's important for being able to give a good description (the most common info that I have trouble finding is what AI model(s) is/are used, and whether or not the application is filtered), and there are a few where I'm just unsure if they really have enough of a niche to justify being on this list.**",
