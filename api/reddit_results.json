During my college research, I got to know about UIUC's amazing alumni, and all of the rankings also ranked the program pretty high. But I was still confused about **how does UIUC's CS program rivals the programs offered by other prestigious universities** such as GaTech, MIT, Stanford etc. Also, I wanted to know **what makes it special and sets it apart** and **how are the job and entrepreneurial opportunities offered at UIUC**.  \n\n\n[Acceptance](https://preview.redd.it/ax5wegssdyma1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=43b8937a8b1c57c0bc6b81966a89b1de98ef6be9)",

        "question_text": "UIUC Salary Expectancy CS\n\nSo Iâ€™m trying to decide whether or not I want to go to UIUC for CS. I am deciding between there and Missouri S&T. UIUC has posted that the average CS starting salary is 130k with a 35k signing bonus. I would be taking on quite a bit of debt going to UIUC so I really need to know if those numbers are true. Is there anyone who has gone there that is willing to share with me any salaries they have made (also anyone at S&T). 130k starting sounds absolutely insane.",
        "answer_text": "Lot of water has flown under the bridge since 2021 (literally peak in CS hiring with TikTokâ€™s of how tech folks spend their day at work - gourmet breakfast/lunch to champagne in evening). That said, think long term and UIUC would be better option.",

        "question_text": "Help me convince my parents to go to UIUC for CS!\n\nSo I just got admitted into UIUC for CS!\n\nI know it's a very prestigious program but my parents have never heard of it so I need to convince them how valuable going to a school like UIUC for CS actually is. They would rather I go to UF for free and with the possibility of getting a National Merit scholarship for about 22k a year which is another valid option. But if I went to UF I would want to do pre-med and would have to end up paying for medical school anyway, so I think finishing school faster at an amazing CS program like UIUC's is the best choice for me but I just have to convince them. So if any UIUC alums or current students could answer some questions to help me out, I would greatly appreciate it:\n\n1. Is UIUC truly a feeder to top tech companies as long as you put in the work to put yourself out there?\n2. How strong is UIUCâ€™s CS alumni network, and how does it help with job opportunities, mentorship, or career growth?\n3. Is a bachelor's degree from UIUC CS enough to land a full-time job after graduation?\n4. What research opportunities are available for undergraduates in CS, and how competitive are they?\n5. Is the return on investment for attending UIUC CS worth it compared to getting paid to go to UF?\n\nEdit: After reading some responses debt is not too much of an issue and to clarify I already have guaranteed free tuition for UF but with the merit scholarship I could get an extra 22k a year to spend on housing, food, etc. I also realize the necessity of working outside the classroom for CS I already have internship and research experience and I'm continuing to apply for more over this summer heading into freshman year.

I'm wondering if it is worth it to pay full tuition for Stanford (\\~$90k) or if it would be better to go to UIUC or Georgia Tech and get instate tuition (<$35k). Are the opportunities at these three schools similar or is it worth to pay the sticker price for a good private school?\r  \n\r  \n",
